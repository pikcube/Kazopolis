# Optional Gardening Rules

Kazopolis is written to make setup as fast and seamless as possible, but this does require an arbitrary outsider count and eliminates certain characters that complicate setup. These optional gardening rules are an option for groups that are okay with slowing down setup for a particular benefit. These rules can be ran simotaniously if desired.

## Garden the Minions

When gardening minions, the storyteller will not put any minions in the bag, and choose which townsfolks become minions after the demon picks their role. This lets the storyteller modify who they choose (and how many they choose) based on their pick. 

Under this rule, the following characters work differently than above.

### Kazali: If the demon chooses Kazali, they also choose which players are minions.

I'm going to leave it up to storytellers whether or not they want to let the players still pick their roles when picked by Kazali, or if you want to let the Kazali do it, but otherwise this one works exactly the same way you think it would.

### Lord of Typhon: If the demon picks Lord of Typhon, all evil players are in a line.

This is the only way to deal with the dependency of the minion count changing how many minions there are and where they are seated in a Typhon game.

### Summoner: The demon, and only the demon, may choose to be the Summoner.

Since Summoner removes a minion, the storyteller needs to know if it is a summoner game before handing out minions, so it makes since to make it the demon's choice whether to make the game a summoner game.

## Garden the Outsiders

When gardening the outsiders, the storyteller will not put any outsiders in the bag, and choose which townsfolks become outsiders after the minions pick their roles. This allows for the outsider count to be determined by setup modification instead of being arbitrary.

Under this rule, the following characters work differently than above. Most of these are self explanatory.

### Baron: If players select the Baron, there will be +2 outsiders. If the Baron is made drunk by Kazopolis, this doesn't happen.

### Godfather: If players select the Godfather, there will be either -1 or +1 outsider. If the Godfather is made drunk, this does not happen.

### Fang Gu: If a player selects the Fang Gu, there will be +1 outsider.

### Vigor Mortis: If a player selects the Vigor Mortis, there will be -1 outsider.
