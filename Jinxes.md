# Jinxes and Changes

There's over 100 Characters in Blood on the Clocktower, almost none of them are designed to work with duplicates. When running Kazopolis, it is important to consider how certain characters will interact under the new rules and whether a custom ruling is required.

Some characters in Clocktower target a specific character (such as the Courtier or Ojo). These roles weren't originally designed around having multiple copies of a character in play, and their behavior changes as a result. When running Kazopolis, the recommended ruling for targeting a character is to let these roles target every player who picked that character, whether drunk or not.

Some characters modify setup in particular ways. As the character changes when running Kazopolis happen during night 1, any character with setup text requires consideration regarding their ability.

Below are the custom jinxes and ruling I recommend when running Kazopolis.

## Hate Jinxes

These are roles that do not work at all under the base rules of Kazopolis because they modify setup too much. Most of these characters can be made work with certain gardening rules. 

### Summoner: Players may not select the Summoner

Summoner is a very fun role, but doesn't work on Kazopolis. While forcing someone to change their character isn't enough to be banned from Kazopolis (although it is slightly against the spirit of the format), the requirement of knowing that a minion will choose summoner ahead of time does ultimately mean it can't work without *"Gardening the Minions"*.

### Lord of Typhon: Players may not select Lord of Typhon

Lord of Typhon doesn't work for the exact same reason, no minions can be put in the bag until you know Lord of Typhon is in play to satisfy the line and extra minion. If you want to run Lord of Typhon, you'll need *"Garden the Minions"*.

### Kazali: Players may not select Kazali

Kazali has the same problem Lord of Typhon does, but is comes with the bonus of having an entire evil team that doesn't get to pick their role. It can be ran by *Gardening the Minions* but talk with your group about how you plan to run this before you let players pick it. I do recognize it is ironic that you can't be the Kazali in Kazpolis though.

### Engineer: Players may not select the Engineer

Engineer actually does function fine, but it has the issue that the entire evil team might get their role changed out from under them in a game where the gimmick is "you got to pick your role". If your group is okay with this, feel free to include it, and consider letting the engineer create duplicate roles if they wish.

### Legion: Players may not select Legion

I really want Legion to work on Kazopolis! Legion games are so much fun to run! However, letting one player decide that half the town has to be the same role also feels really bad when the players were promised to be able to pick their role. If your group is okay with half of them potentially being told "you are now legion", then feel free to include this role as an option, but please make sure everyone is okay with this potentially happening.

## Not Selectable (But Still Playable)

These are roles that have a special consideration with character selection. Most of these are self explanatory but do require the storyteller to preemtively modify the player counts prior to starting.

### Drunk: Players may not choose to be the drunk. After characters are picked, a townsfolk may become the Drunk.

Since the drunk doesn't know they are the drunk, you really can't have outsiders pick the drunk.

### Lunatic: Players may not choose to be the lunatic. After characters are picked, a demon may become the Lunatic.

This requires putting an extra demon in the bag, or putting the Lunatic token in and letting the lunatic pick a demon.

### Marionette: Players may not choose to be the Marionette. After characters are picked, a good player neighboring the demon may become the Marionette.

As a storyteller, you may need to swap a minion and demon to make marionette work, but otherwise its identical to running the Drunk.

### King: Players may not choose to be the King. After characters are picked, if any players picked Choir Boy, exactly one Choir Boy will become the King.

Multiple Kings is a really nasty problem for the evil team. If there are 3 Kings, the evil team has to spend 3 nights killing the Kings to eliminate them, and only after they are sure there are no Choir Boys in play. Drunking the Kings is even worse because then the demon won't learn who the King is, but the Choir Boy will still be told if the demon kills them.

The solution? Nobody chooses the King. If there are any Choir Boys in play, turn one of them into the King. If there is only 1 Choir Boy, you end up with a King and no Choir boys. If there's more than 1, you get 1 King and multiple Choir Boys (some of which might be drunk).
