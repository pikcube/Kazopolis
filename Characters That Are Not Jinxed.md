# Abilities That Aren't Modified At All

I'll be honest, this section really just exists as a way to remind me why I decided to leave characters unjinxed that initially seemed problematic with Kazopolis.

## Boffin

By default, two boffins can give the demon two separate abilities, and I think that's fine.

## Vizier

Having multiple Viziers is unbalanced, but only because it screws over the evil team by having every / nearly every minion outed to the town. Drunking the duplicates in the case of a Vizier might actually be a buff to the evil team, which is hilarious.

## Boomdandy

Boomdandy is weird. Three players the town can't execute seems strong, but whether it would be unbalanced really depends on script composition, there are probably scripts where three would be just fine.

Drunking a Boomdandy could lead to a situation where a player is executed but doesn't explode, which could feel bad, but because the player doesn't have to claim evil as part of using their ability this seems like less of an issue than the Psychopath.

This is a great candidate for the optional rule about duplicate evils repicking instead of being made drunk.

## Evil Twin

Sort of like Vizier, I think evil is probably the one who gets screwed over by having duplicates. Also, I don't know anyone who would willingly choose to enter a twin pair when players can try and meta "who would choose to be in a twin pair".

## Wizard

Wizard is a character that I considered adding a "sanity" jinx for, where the Storyteller can prompt them to choose a different character if they aren't emotionally ready to try and run a 3 Wizard game. For the most part I'm trying to avoid jinxes purely for ST sanity when that can be solved by a discussion of boundaries. The optional rule about letting minions repick would solve this problem too though.

Besides, you agreed to run a Kazopolis game on a script with *Wizard* on it. What did you think would happen?

## Widow

It might be worth clarifying whether or not the Widow ping is a hard once or not. Right now I think one ping per Widow is probably a good idea.

## Poisoner

Just drunk all but one of the copies. Once the poisoners find out there are multiple poisoners, they can either try and coordinate or spray and pray.

## Barber

Yes the Barber forcibly swaps your role on the "choose your ability" rules, but if you run a script that has Barber on it with Kazopolis, you know what they are getting into.

## Golem

Golem doesn't need a jinx, but I do want to point out that making every Golem drunk is the best way to run multiple Golems.

## Goon

I did have Goon jinxed at one point, but I'm less worried about roles that flip alignments than I am about roles that don't flip. Besides, a drunk goon will just stay good all game and that's ultimately fine.

At most I would give Goon the same jinx Ogre has.

## Recluse

Yes, but don't.

## Poppy Grower

So as of now, killing the first Poppy Grower reveals the evil team (since Poppy Grower is written to give the information on death instead of stopping the evil team from learning each other while alive). I think that's probably fine.

## Mayor

I'm actually worried Mayor might ultimately be unplayable on Kazopolis since any threat of duplicates will make going for a mayor win even less reliable than it was before. I'm not sure what to do about it though, so I'm leaving it unjinxed.

## Tea Lady

Just drunk them, that's the whole reason the drunk duplicates rule exists.

## Banshee

Banshee + drunk duplicates + multiple ways to die at night might be a bad combination, but I'm not sure it rises to the level of needing a global ruling. Plus, giving Townsfolks and Outsiders any meta info about in play good roles is much more dangerous than giving the evil team info about in play evil roles.

## Minstrel

This one might benefit from a clarification, but as written multiple sober Minstrels actually work fine. I don't want to get into whether or not abilities are allowed to activate simultaneously, but you actually get the same result in both cases.

If you try and proc all the Minstrels at the same time, everyone is drunk, which drunks the Minstrel, which makes everyone sober, which means the Minstrel drunks everyone, and so forth. It's been ruled that in the event of a cycle causing players to alternate between being poison and not poisoned (such as self poisoning), they are treated as poisoned until something in the game state allows the cycle to have a different steady resolution. As a result, you get this funny situation where everyone including the Minstrels are drunk, but that's not functionally any different than a normal Minstrel day.

If you instead proc the Minstrels one after the other, then the first Minstrel drunks all the others, which gives you basically the same result. However, try to not end up in a situation where which Minstrel was left sober is somehow mechanically relevant.

## Farmer

I feel like every demon's bane could use the same clarification, but if multiple players picking farmer is too strong, drunk some of them. That's why this rule exists.

## Philosopher

Philosopher doesn't strictly need to drunk the role they choose, but it's not a problem either.

## Amnesiac

I'm not going to write a jinx for the character whose ability lets the storyteller manipulate the grimoire so hard it could run Doom, but please don't drunk duplicate Amnesiacs. Amnesiac is already a rough time when you can't figure out your ability, having no ability to figure out would be even worse.

At the end of the day, the storyteller has the tools to balance multiple Amnesiacs by adjusting the abilities given, and if a storyteller doesn't want to run Amne they can either ask players to not pick it or play a different script.

## Savant

Running multiple Savants sounds like my personal nightmare, but that's the risk you get when running a script with Savant on it.

## Gossip

This one might not be balanced if they are all sober, but it will be very funny.

## Exorcist

This would need to be a hard "different from last night" if you kept them all sober, but for the love of god don't do that.

## Cult Leader

Drunk Cult Leader isn't the end of the world, and might even figure it out when they somehow never get an evil ping.

## Snake Charmer

This one doesn't need a jinx, but check with your group about whether they are okay with multiple sober Snake Charmers.

## Preacher

I mean multiple Preachers isn't fun, but it's nothing making them drunk doesn't solve.

## High Priestess

I'd probably leave them all sober.

## Engineer

I think this role is not in the spirit of Kazopolis, and probably shouldn't be included on a Kazopolis script. But if you include Engineer on script, you know what you are getting into.
