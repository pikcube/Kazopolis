# Kazopolis: A New Way to Play Blood on the Clocktower

Kazopolis is a custom project that has been in development for a few months at this point, and is a collaboration between me, my partner, and our local clocktower group to answer a question nobody asked, "what if everyone just picked their role?".

The end result is this, what was originally a fable but at this point could be described as a different format entirely with how you rethink your strategy.

The exact rule is "On night 1, each player may choose to become any character of the same type. Duplicates might be drunk. [? Outsiders]".

This means that everyone can pick the role thay think would be most fun to play as, but they must consider what everyone else might pick too. If everyone picks the same role, the town will have no way to figure out who is drunk and who is sober.

Evil players normally try to bluff out of play roles, but bluffing in play roles is now also extremely powerful. Since duplicates are possible, double claims imply that players might secretly be drunk, which can make the good team distrust otherwise helpful information.

## How To Run a Game of Kazopolis

The way to run Kazopolis is very simple. Pass out a bag of tokens with any number of outsiders (I'd personally stick to plus or minus the base amount). During the first night, wake each character (before doing any other night interactions) and let them point to any character on script. They are that character now, swap it out in the grimoire.

After everyone is picked, look at the grimoire. If you are happy with the state of the game, you can run it as is. Otherwise, you are free to drunk any player who selected the same token as another in play character. This drunkenness is static and does not change over the course of the game.

## The Nitty Gritty

Kazopolis is a lot of fun, but it's only for groups that are ready for games to potentially be a bit one sided just due to which roles ended up where. Sometimes the player sitting next to the demon happens to choose Shugenja and the evil team has no way to counter that information.

Some roles get really out of hand with duplicates in play (what I like to call "the 5 Virgin problem"). Giving the storyteller the ability to drunk duplicates is a dial to ensure that roles that stack in a very unfun way don't end up entirely shattering the game.

We originally battle tested this on Fish Bucket, and it is a pretty fun way to play, but the rule was designed for standard scripts of 25 characters. The script "Hat Shop" was written specifically for playing with these rules (and was my personal submission to the "Garden of Djinn" script competition).

## To Drunk or Not to Drunk

Learning when to drunk duplicates and when to leave them sober is one of the hardest parts about running Kazopolis.

In general, I usually avoid drunking the evil team if I can avoid it. There are some roles where it is necessary (mez) but drunking a minion is ultimately far more damaging than drunking a townsfolk. As a ST, you may wish to consider using an optional rule to let the evil team in particular repick instead of making them drunk.

Outsiders are very fun on Kazopolis, as many of them get much worse when duplicates are introduced. Having 4 Zealots will give the evil team a lot of voting power. Having 4 Recluses will shread the good team's information. I generally recommend using an "All or Nothing" approach with drunking outsiders, either leaving all of them sober or drunking all the copies.

When deciding whether or not to drunk a townsfolk, the main question to consider is "will evil be able to play around them being sober?". Some roles are way to strong when they are all sober, such as the Virgin or Courtier, and drunking all of them (or all but 1) is frequently the way to go. Some roles are perfectly fine to leave everyone sober, I don't usually drunk duplicate Stewards or Washerwomen unless I think it's going to close evils play space too much.
